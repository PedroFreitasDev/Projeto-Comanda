Welcome,

This project aims to create a command and order management system for a local snack bar, aligned with the teaching units of our college.

Owners: Pedro de Freitas da Silva and

We are students of the university of UNIFEOB (Octavio Barros Education Foundation) and this project was proposed by our teachers and coordinators as a way to understand how the job market works, we decide to learn how to use git and the github by ourselves and this is the first project we are using it.

That all, thank you for reading!
